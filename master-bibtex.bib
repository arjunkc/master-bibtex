  abstract     = {The quasi-periodic homogenization for some classes of first-order Hamilton-Jaconi-Bellman equation is studied in this paper. The cell problem of the quasi-periodic homogenization satisfies the non-resonance condition, under which the corresponding deterministic system is ergodic. The almost periodic homogenization for the same classes of equations is also solved, as a limit of a sequence of quasi-periodic homogenizations. Here, the almost periodicity is in the sense of H. Bohr. This result has been cited by some authors, for example: by H. Ishii, "Almost periodic homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations", in Int. Conf. on Diff.

In this survey, we describe the main results of first passage percolation, paying special attention to the recent burst of advances of the past 5 years. The purpose of these notes is twofold. In the first chapters, we give self-contained proofs of seminal results obtained in the '80s and '90s on limit shapes and geodesics, while covering the state of the art of these questions. Second, aside from these classical results, we discuss recent perspectives and directions including (1) the connection between Busemann functions and geodesics, (2) the proof of sublinear variance under 2+log moments of passage times and (3) the role of growth and competition models. We also provide a collection of (old and new) open questions, hoping to solve them before the 100th birthday.},

This establishes the long-standing belief among physicists that the Parisi solution in mean-field models is universal. Our results extend to universal properties of other physical observables in the mixed p-spin model as well as in different spin glass models. These include universality of quenched disorder chaos in the Edwards-Anderson (EA) model and quenched concentration for the magnetization in both EA and mixed p-spin models under non-Gaussian environments. In addition, we show quenched self-averaging for the overlap in the random field Ising model under small perturbation of the external field.},

  abstract     = {Given an infinite connected graph, a way to randomly perturb its metric is to assign random i.i.d. lengths to the edges. An open question attributed to Furstenberg is whether there exists a two-sided infinite geodesic in first passage percolation on Z{\textasciicircum}2, and more generally on Z{\textasciicircum}n for n{\textgreater}1. Although the answer is generally conjectured to be negative, we give a positive answer for graphs satisfying some negative curvature assumption. Assuming only strict positivity and finite expectation of the random lengths, we prove that if a graph X has bounded degree and contains a Morse geodesic (e.g. is non-elementary Gromov hyperbolic), then almost surely, there exists a bi-infinite geodesic in first passage percolation on X.},

  note         = {arXiv: 0907.3381},
  abstract     = {We prove that the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of spin glasses is chaotic under small perturbations of the couplings at any temperature in the absence of an external field. The result is proved for two kinds of perturbations: (a) distorting the couplings via Ornstein-Uhlenbeck flows, and (b) replacing a small fraction of the couplings by independent copies. We further prove that the S-K model exhibits multiple valleys in its energy landscape, in the weak sense that there are many states with near-minimal energy that are mutually nearly orthogonal. We show that the variance of the free energy of the S-K model is unusually small at any temperature. (By `unusually small' we mean that it is much smaller than the number of sites; in other words, it beats the classical Gaussian concentration inequality, a phenomenon that we call `superconcentration'.) We prove that the bond overlap in the Edwards-Anderson model of spin glasses is not chaotic under perturbations of the couplings, even large perturbations. Lastly, we obtain sharp lower bounds on the variance of the free energy in the E-A model on any bounded degree graph, generalizing a result of Wehr and Aizenman and establishing the absence of superconcentration in this class of models. Our techniques apply for the p-spin models and the Random Field Ising Model as well, although we do not work out the details in these cases.},

  note         = {arXiv: 1512.00804},
  abstract     = {In first-passage percolation, we place i.i.d. continuous weights at the edges of Z{\textasciicircum}2 and consider the weighted graph metric. A distance-minimizing path between points x and y is called a geodesic, and a bigeodesic is a doubly-infinite path whose segments are geodesics. It is a famous conjecture that almost surely, there are no bigeodesics. In the '90s, Licea-Newman showed that, under a curvature assumption on the "asymptotic shape", all infinite geodesics have an asymptotic direction, and there is a full-measure set D of [0, 2 pi) such that for any theta in D, there are no bigeodesics with one end directed in direction theta. In this paper, we show that there are no bigeodesics with one end directed in any deterministic direction, assuming the shape boundary is differentiable. This rules out existence of ground state pairs for the related disordered ferromagnet whose interface has a deterministic direction. Furthermore, it resolves the Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm "midpoint problem" under the extra assumption that the limit shape boundary is differentiable.},

We prove universality of the local eigenvalue statistics and optimal local laws for the resolvent away from the spectral edges, generalizing the recent result of [arXiv:1604.08188] to allow slow correlation decay and arbitrary expectation. The main novel tool is a systematic diagrammatic control of a multivariate cumulant expansion.},
